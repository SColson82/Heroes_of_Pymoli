# Pandas-Challenge: Heroes of PyMoli

* 1.) Purchase count increases up to the Age Range of 20-24 and then begins to decrease. Players in this age range are also  more likely to make multiple purchases than any other age group.
* 2.) The vast majority of purchases are made by male players between the age of 20-24 followed by 15-19. The top spenders  are 80% male between 20 and 25. 
* 3.) Interestingly, only 2 of the most popular items list also appear on the top spenders list and only 1 of each was purchased. Same for the most profitable list. Oathbreaker appears on both the most popular and the most profitable list despite having more than one purchase price listed in the original data frame which I assume means that it was popular partially due to being on sale or otherwise marked down. 
* 4.) Final Critic, Oathbreaker, and Fiery Glass Crusader are all on both the most profitable and the most popular items lists. However, only Oathbreaker is also on the list of items purchased by the top spenders.
